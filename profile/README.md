Japa is an API first testing framework. It focuses only on testing Node.js (backend) applications, thus resulting in a fast, small, and a simple tests runner.

## Features
Despite being a small and a simple tests runner. Japa has a ton of features you expect from a testing framework. It includes:

- Support for [test groups](), timeout, todo and [regression tests]().
- Support for [Datasets]().
- Support for test suites.
- [Assertion libraries]() with support for assertion planning.
- Ability to [filter]() and run specific or only failing tests.
- Re-imagined [lifecycle hooks]().
- Multiple [reporters]() to display tests progress.
- Great CLI experience with pretty diffs and formatted error stacks.
- Works with [ESM]() and [TypeScript]() both with zero additional setup.

## Why Japa?
There are many testing frameworks available in the JavaScript ecosystem. However, a majority of them are heavily influenced by the frontend ecosystem or we can say they are frontend first.

On the other hand Japa is only meant to work with Node.js to test backend applications like a web app or a CLI tool.

This laser focus today allows to produce a relatively simpler codebase and also **grow the ecosystem around the needs of backend testing**.
